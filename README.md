# Workflow Automation and Orchestration Framework

In this repo, 

- We will learn the `Workflow Automation and Orchestration Framework`. 
- We will play with various workflow automation frameworks, such as:
    - prefect
    - airflow
    - argo workflow

## 1. Definition of Workflow Automation and Orchestration Framework

A `workflow automation and orchestration framework` coordinates multiple tasks(often interdependent) so that complex 
processes run reliably, observably, and efficiently without human intervention.

 - **Automation**: Executes pre-defined tasks automatically (**Execution**.)
 - **Orchestration**: Ensures multiple automated components run in the right order, with state tracking, error 
                       handling, and data passing between them. (**Coordination**)

## 2. Key Components of a Workflow Orchestration Framework

| Component	                 | Description	                                                         | Prefect Analogy                                                                     | Airflow Analogy                                                            |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Task                       | 	The smallest executable unit (a function, script, or command).	     | @task decorator                                                                     | PythonOperator, BashOperator, or any Airflow operator.                     |
| Flow / DAG                 | 	A directed acyclic graph defining task order and dependencies.      | 	@flow decorator                                                                    | DAG object — defines Directed Acyclic Graph structure.                     |
| Task Dependency Management | Defines order and relationships between tasks (upstream/downstream). | Python call order (task_a() → task_b()). Prefect infers dependencies automatically. | Explicitly defined using >> or << operators (task_a >> task_b).            |
| Scheduler                  | 	Decides when to run flows (e.g., hourly, daily, triggered).         | 	Prefect deployments & schedules                                                    | Airflow Scheduler with schedule_interval (cron, timedelta, etc.).          |
| Executor / Worker          | 	Runs tasks on compute resources (local, Docker, cluster).           | 	Prefect worker(pulls jobs from a Work Pool and executes flows.)                    | Executor — runs tasks via Celery, LocalExecutor, or KubernetesExecutor.    |
| State Manager              | 	Tracks running, success, retry, fail, cancel states.	               | Prefect Orion state engine                                                          | askInstance and DagRun states (success, failed, up_for_retry, etc.).       |
| Observer / Logger          | 	Records logs, metrics, and events for debugging.	                   | Prefect UI & logging                                                                | Airflow Web UI (http://localhost:8080) — DAG-based view.                   |
| Configuration Store        | 	Holds environment variables, credentials, or secrets.	              | Prefect Blocks                                                                      | Connections / Variables in Airflow (stored in metadata DB or environment). |
| API / Backend              | 	Central coordination hub for flows and tasks.	                      | Prefect API Server                                                                  | Airflow Webserver + Scheduler + Metadata DB (tightly coupled).             |


## 3. Automation vs. Orchestration

| Dimension	|Automation	|Orchestration|
|Scope	|Single task or script	|Multiple tasks with dependencies|
|Goal	|Reduce manual execution |Ensure end-to-end process consistency|
|Example |	Run a Spark job daily |	Run extract → transform → validate → load, in sequence|

## 4.Core Principles Behind Workflow Orchestration

### 4.1 State Awareness

Every task has a state (e.g., Pending, Running, Completed, Failed).
`Orchestration Framework` tracks transitions between states, which allows:
- Retry logic
- Conditional branching (if success → do next step)


### 4.2. Task Lineage and Dependency Graph(DAGS)

The `Orchestration Framework` 
- ensures tasks dependency defined in a dag: `extract → transform → validate → load → notify`
- tracks inputs and outputs, making debugging easier.

### 4.3. Scheduling and Triggers

The `Orchestration Frameworks`  manage when to run workflows:
- Time-based: cron-like (daily, weekly)
- Event-based: file arrival, API signal, database change
- Manual trigger: via CLI or API

### 4.4. Retry and Error Handling

Built-in resilience:

- Retry failed tasks up to N times
- Pause or continue depending on conditions
- Mark run as `Failed` or `Recovered`


### 4.5. Observability

Orchestration provides visibility into:
- Execution time per task
- Failure reasons
- Logs and stdout
- Resource usage

In Prefect, this is visible in the `Orion dashboard` and stored in the `SQLite/PostgreSQL` backend.

### 4.6. Parameterization and Dynamic Workflows

Flows can take parameters to control behavior:

```python
@flow
def etl(dataset: str, date: str):
    ...

```

>> Enables reusing the same logic for multiple datasets.

### 4.7. Execution Environment Abstraction

The orchestrator separates `workflow logic` from `runtime`.
With the same workflow code, you can:
- Run locally for testing.
- Move to a cluster (Kubernetes, Dask, Ray).
